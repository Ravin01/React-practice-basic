Lifecycle is the main reason for development of react.

1. Initial
2. Mounting phase
    Components render for the first time,created and inserted into the DOM
    1. Constructor() *
    2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
    3. render() *
    4. componentDidMount() *
3. Updating phase
    If any interactions happened to the component through props or state, component will update.
    This is the re-render process and comes from the DOM. 
    1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
    2. shouldComponentUpdate() *
    3. render() *
    4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    5. componentDidUpdate() *
4. Unmounting phase
    Component is being removed from the DOM.
    1.componentWillUnmount() *

Constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount => only used in class components

but using useEffect hook ,which makes easier to use lifecycle of components 
and also used in functional components also.
